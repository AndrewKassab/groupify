        <p>
          With Groupify you can create playlists that everyone is sure to enjoy.
          Whether you're just hanging out with friends or <br> going for a drive, Groupify is sure to 
          generate a playlist where every user gets their fair share of music.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enjoy music in a new way with your friends. 
        </p>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          Groupify will generate a playlist for you where every user gets a roughly 
          equal share of the track pool. <br> By default, a user's track pool will consist 
          of a shuffled list of their most-played tracks over the past month. <br> If you choose to do so, you can 
          replace this track pool with tracks from pre-existing playlists just by 
          selecting them. <br> Our algorithm will then go through each user's track pool and 
          add in songs, making sure to prioritize tracks <br> that more group members are familiar 
          with. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is a playlist that reflects everyone's tastes!
        </p>
        <h3>
          I can't find my friend's! <span role="img" arial-label="OMG" />
          ðŸ˜¬
        </h3>
        <p>
          No problem at all! In order to create a group playlist with Spotify, each user 
          in the group must have logged <br> into Groupify before. Go ahead and send your friends 
          our link at 
          <a href="http://groupify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            groupify.com
          </a> and have them hit sign in. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You should now be set to find and create your first playlist with your friend!
        </p>
        <h3>Spotify Access / Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          Application requires a Spotify account. It also needs access to your Spotify account. <br>
          Application does not save your Spotify data and only accesses it for the purpose 
          of generating a playlist.
