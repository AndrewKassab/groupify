            With Groupify you can create playlists that everyone is sure to enjoy.
            Whether you're just hanging out with friends or going for a drive, Groupify is sure to
            generate a playlist where every user gets their fair share of music.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enjoy music together.
          </p>
          <h2>How It Works</h2>
          <p>
            Groupify will generate a playlist where every user gets a roughly
            equal share of the track pool. By default, a user's track pool will consist
            of their most-played tracks over the past month. You can replace this
            track pool with tracks from pre-existing playlists just by selecting them.
            Groupify will then go through each user's track pool and add in songs,
            making sure to prioritize tracks that more group members are familiar with.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result is a playlist that reflects everyone's tastes!
          </p>
          <h3>
            I can't find my friend's Spotify accounts! <span role="img" arial-label="OMG" />
            ðŸ˜¬
          </h3>
          <p>
            No problem at all! In order to create a group playlist with Spotify, each group member
            must have logged into Groupify before. Go ahead and send your friends
            {/* our link at <a href="http://groupify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">groupify.com</a> and have them hit sign in. */}
            here and have them sign in!
          </p>
          <p>
            You should now be set to find your friend and begin creating a playlist!
          </p>
          <h3>Spotify Access / Privacy</h3>
          <p>
            Application requires a Spotify account. It also needs access to your Spotify account.
            Application does not save your Spotify data and only accesses it for the purpose
            of generating a playlist.
